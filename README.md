**Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)**

Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is a Python-based system that uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to detect and recognize vehicle license plates. This system automatically reads the license plate, identifies the characters, and stores the data along with the timestamp in a CSV file for record-keeping.
